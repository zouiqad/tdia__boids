# TDIA BOIDS

TDIA BOIDS is a University project developed as part of the AI course at Gamagora. This project simulates the behavior of boids to create lifelike swimming fishes flocking patterns using artificial intelligence techniques.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zouiqad/tdia__boids.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have Unity version ``2021.3.5f1`` or later installed.
3. Open the project in Unity.

## Usage

Once the project is opened in Unity:

1. Open the `Scenes` folder and load the main scene.
2. Press the `Play` button in the Unity editor to run the simulation.
3. Adjust boid parameters in the Inspector to see how different settings affect the flocking behavior.

## Features

- **Flocking Simulation**: Implements classic boid behaviors like separation, alignment, and cohesion.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust various parameters to change the behavior of the boids (steering force, speed, perception ...) modify `Settings` Scriptable Object attributes.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Observe how boids react in real-time to changes in their environment.
